# Plumber Logging

The [Plumber R package](https://www.rplumber.io/docs/) is used to expose R
processes and functions as API endpoints. Due to Plumber's incredible
flexibility, most major API design decisions are left up to the developer. One
important consideration to be made when developing APIs is how to log
information about API requests and responses. This information can be used to
determine how Plumber APIs are performing and how they are being utilized. This
repository contains an example of how logging can be implemented and monitored
in a Plumber API.

## Logging
The Plumber documentation contains [an
example](https://www.rplumber.io/docs/routing-and-input.html#forward-to-another-handler)
of logging information about an incoming request as part of a
[filter](https://www.rplumber.io/docs/routing-and-input.html#filters). This
approach works, but it doesn't allow information about the response to be logged
since the response hasn't been generated when the log entry is written. The
approach detailed in this repository uses [preroute and postroute
hooks](https://www.rplumber.io/docs/programmatic-usage.html#router-hooks) to log
information about each API request and its associated response. The logs are
written using the [logger](https://daroczig.github.io/logger/) package for
convenience. [`entrypoint.R`](R/entrypoint.R) shows how preroute and postroute
hooks are used to generate a log entry:

```{r entrypoint}
```

In this example, the [tictoc](http://collectivemedia.github.io/tictoc/) package
is used so that the log can include the execution time of the API. It's
important to note that this value does not represent the total amount of time a
client waits for a response, since it doesn't include any time that the request
may have been queued before being processed. Instead, this value represents the
amount of time the response took to generate once the request was received. Each
log entry contains the following information:

- Log level: This is a distinction made by the logger package, and in this
example the value is always INFO
- Timestamp: The timestamp for when the response was generated and sent back to
the client
- Remote Address: The address of the client making the request
- User Agent: The user agent making the request
- Http Host: The host of the API
- Method: The HTTP method attached to the request
- Path: The specific API endpoint requested
- Status: The HTTP status of the response
- Execution Time: The amount of time from when the request received until the
reponse was generated

This log format is loosely inspired by the [NCSA Common log
format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Log_Format). An example log file is
provided below:

```
INFO [2019-07-27 10:34:28] 127.0.0.1 "Siege/4.0.4" localhost:9207 GET /echo 200 0.0380000000000003
INFO [2019-07-27 10:34:28] 127.0.0.1 "Siege/4.0.4" localhost:9207 GET /plot 200 0.0689999999999991
INFO [2019-07-27 10:34:28] 127.0.0.1 "Siege/4.0.4" localhost:9207 GET /echo 200 0.00100000000000122
INFO [2019-07-27 10:34:28] 127.0.0.1 "Siege/4.0.4" localhost:9207 GET /echo 200 0.00300000000000011
INFO [2019-07-27 10:34:29] 127.0.0.1 "Siege/4.0.4" localhost:9207 GET /echo 200 0.00199999999999889
```

## Monitoring
Once the log files have been generated, they can be used to analyze API usage
and performance. This repository contains an [example Shiny
application](R/shiny/app.R) that monitors a specified directory for new log
files or updates to existing log files. This application provides real time
details about API usage and performance.

## Deployment
Plumber APIs can be [deployed](https://www.rplumber.io/docs/hosting.html) in a
variety of ways. This logging solution can be adapted to work with any
deployment pattern, since you can specify where the log files are written using
`logger::log_appender()`. [RStudio Connect](www.rstudio.com/products/connect/)
is a particularly attractive deployment option since it drastocally simplifies
the deployment process and it supports Shiny applications, so the monitoring
dashboard can be deployed to RStudio Connect as well. The following steps can be
used to take advantage of this pattern on RStudio Connect:

1. Publish the Plumber API with logging enabled
2. Ensure that the log files are written to a persistent location with proper
permissions (for example, `/var/log/plumber`)
3. Make sure the Shiny dashboard is configured to monitor the location of the
Plumber log files (the [config R package](https://github.com/rstudio/config) is
used in this example)
4. Publish the Shiny dashboard to RStudio Connect
